# Challenge-1-Silly-Putty-writeup
This is the documentation of the malware I have analysed as part of the TCM academy's Practical Malware Analysis Course.

As you can see this is a Challenge given to me and that's why you see files like challenge questions. The basic task are all give in the challenge question file and you have to breakdown the binary and analyse it using basic static and basic dynamic analysis. Please refer to the my_answers file to see the writeup for this challenge.
